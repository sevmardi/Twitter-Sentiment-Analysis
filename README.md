# Twitter Sentiment Analysis App
This is a school project developed during my education as CS bachelor. 

Objective: Using twitter api (or any other 3d party software ) try to analyse at least 10,000 tweets, followed by saving those
tweets in DB ( MySQL, MongoDB, or any other of your choice) and display the results
by using at least three 3d party libraries of data science.
